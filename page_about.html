		Hello, I’m Samantha. I spent the past 6 years designing data for <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphiq" target="_blank">Graphiq</a>, a knowledge graph provider with multiple data products, and then for <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa" target="_blank">Alexa</a>. I am a designer with an engineering mindset and a degree in marketing analytics. The unique combo made it possible for me go deep in technology like a computer scientist, and also understand people like a social scientist<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.

They are the ones who can manage the shifting standards and technologies that seemingly change every week. They are the ones the world needs right now.”</em>
