desc: I spent the past 6 years designing data for Graphiq, a knowledge graph provider with multiple data products, and then for Alexa. I am a designer with an engineering mindset and a degree in marketing analytics. The unique combo made it possible for me go deep in technology like a computer scientist, and also understand people like a social scientist.

	<p>
		<strong>Hello, I'm Samantha.</strong> I'm a UX designer living in the SF Bay Area.
	</p>
	<p>
		My journey as a designer has been about closing the gap between complex systems and the people who use them. I started my career designing data at scale for <a href="https://alexa.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Alexa</a> , and then took that experience to the ultimate test: co-founding <a href="https://useagave.com/" target="_blank">Agave</a>, a B2B SaaS company I helped build from zero-to-one.
	</p>
	<p>
		This journey has shaped my belief that the best products are not just solutions, but catalysts for clarity and trust. My goal is to build these kinds of experiences—products that are simple, scalable, and genuinely useful. I thrive in the space between user needs, technical possibilities, and business strategy, working to build the systems that bring them all together.
