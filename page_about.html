desc: I spent the past 6 years designing data for Graphiq, a knowledge graph provider with multiple data products, and then for Alexa. I am a designer with an engineering mindset and a degree in marketing analytics. The unique combo made it possible for me go deep in technology like a computer scientist, and also understand people like a social scientist.

	<p>
		Hello, I'm Samantha, a product designer & builder based in the Bay Area.
	</p>
	<p>
		My journey has been about closing the gap between complex systems and the people who use them. I spent years designing multimodal knowledge experiences for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa" target="_blank">Amazon Alexa</a>, then took that expertise to the next level by co-founding <a href="https://useagave.com/" target="_blank">Agave</a>&mdash;a B2B SaaS company I built from zero-to-one.
	</p>
	<p>
		These experiences taught me that great design doesn't happen in a vacuum. It happens at the intersection of user needs, engineering reality, and business&nbsp;strategy.
	</p>
	<p>
		I thrive in that intersection. Whether I'm crafting a design system or building a prototype, my goal is always the same: to turn ambiguity into clarity, and complex constraints into products that people genuinely love.
